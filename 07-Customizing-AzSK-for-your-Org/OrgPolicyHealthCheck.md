#### When and why should I check org policy health 

AzSK keeps on adding and enhancing features with different capabilities to monitor Security compliance for Org subscriptions. During these enhancement in new releases, it may include latest features and also some breaking changes. To provide smoother upgrade and avoid policy break, AzSK provides feature for Org policy to run AzSK components with specific version using configuration(mentioned in AzSK.Pre.json). Currently, we have come up with health and fix script which will validate all mandatory resources and latest configurations are in place. In upcoming release these scripts will be part of AzSK commands.
