## 190715 (AzSK v.3.15.0)

### Feature updates


*	DevOps Kit for PowerShell Core (Preview):
	*	All the salient features of DevOps Kit (CA, SVT, Org-policy and other AzSK PowerShell cmdlets) are now supported on PowerShell Core. 
	*	The CA related cmdlets (ICA, GCA, RCA, etc.) will be completed in the next sprint.
	*	The instructions to try these out will be updated at  https://aka.ms/devopskit/pscore .

*	(Preview) Credential Hygiene:
	*	We now offer a register-and-track solution to help monitor the last update of your credentials. This will help you periodically track the health of your credentials which are nearing expiry/need rotation.
	*	The following cmdlets have been introduced to support this functionality:
	*	**New-AzSKTrackedCredential** to onboard a credential for tracking via DevOps Kit. You can set the reminder period (in days) for the credential.
	*	**Get-AzSKTrackedCredential** to list the onboarded credential(s). 
	*	**Update-AzSKTrackedCredential** to update the credential settings and reset the last updated timestamp. 
	*	**Remove-AzSKTrackedCredential** to deboard a credential from AzSK tracking.  
	*	A new control ‘Azure_Subscription_Check_Credential_Rotation’ has been introduced in the GSS scan to help keep a check on all the tracked credentials.

*	DevOps Kit controls expressed as Azure Policy (in progress):
	*	Authored Azure Policy for 5 more DevOps Kit baseline controls. These have been submitted to the Azure Security Center (ASC) team for inclusion in the ASC initiative.


*	Security Verification Tests (SVTs):
	*	Support for severity-based filter for GRS & GSS cmdlets.

*	ARM Template Checker:
	*	Support for severity-based filter for ARM template scans.

*	CICD:
	*	N/A
 
*	(Preview) In-cluster security scans for ADB, AKS, HDI Spark
	*	In tune with the regular DevOps Kit CA cmdlets (ICA, GCA, UCA & RCA), in-cluster CA now supports the following (besides the install-cmd):
		*	Get-AzSKContinuousAssuranceForCluster 
		*	Update-AzSKContinuousAssuranceForCluster 
		*	Remove-AzSKContinuousAssuranceForCluster 
	*	The above cmdlets are currently available in the main AzSK module for Databricks and HDI Spark. For AKS, use instructions available at https://aka.ms/devopskit/inclusterca


*	Log Analytics:
	*	N/A


Note: The next few items mention features from recent releases retained for visibility in case you missed those release announcements:

*	Privileged Identity Management (PIM) helper cmdlets (from last sprint)  
	*	Set-AzSKPIMConfiguration for configuring/changing PIM settings
	*	Get-AzSKPIMConfiguration for querying various PIM settings/status
	*	Activating your PIM role is now as simple as this:
		pim -ActivateMyRole -SubscriptionId $s5 -DurationInHours 8 -Justification 'ad hoc test' -RoleName Owner
	*	See docs [here](https://github.com/azsk/DevOpsKit-docs/blob/master/01-Subscription-Security/Readme.md#azsk-privileged-identity-management-pim-helper-cmdlets-1) for more.

*	(Preview) Security Scan for Azure Active Directory (AAD)
	*	You can scan security controls for your AAD tenant (as either an admin or even as a regular user) using the DevOps Kit AAD Security Scan module.
	*	Use following steps:
		 AAD scan cmdlets are packaged as a separate module (AzSK.AAD)
		```Powershell
		Install-module AzSK.AAD -Scope CurrentUser -AllowClobber
		Import-module AzSK.AAD
		Get-AzSKAADSecurityStatusTenant    # to check the tenant (admin)
		Get-AzSKAADSecurityStatusUser      # to check objects you own (user) 
		```
	*	Caveats: 
		*	Do not run these in the same PS session as AzSK. Start a new PS console.
		*	Az- modules require .Net Framework v4.7.2.
		*	By default, the current cmdlets will scan just 3 objects of each type (Apps/SPNs/Groups, etc.). This is until we work out how best to group/batch scans when scanning the entire tenant. If you want to scan more objects you can use the ‘-MaxObj’ switch in the cmdlets.

*	(Preview) AzSK module for Azure DevOps (VSTS) 
	*	You can try the scan cmdlet using:
  		#VSTS scan cmdlet is in a separate module called AzSK.AzureDevOps!
  		Install-Module AzSK.AzureDevOps -Scope CurrentUser -AllowClobber    
  		Get-AzSKAzureDevOpsSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "MicrosoftIT"`
                                    -ProjectNames "OneITVSO"`
                                    -BuildNames "build_name_here"`
                                    -ReleaseNames "release_name_here"  
.
*	Org-policy updates (for non-CSEO users):
	*	See CA section in “Other improvements/bug fixes” below to install CA in environments where subscription ownership resides with a different team. 


### Other improvements/bug fixes

*	Subscription Security:
	*	N/A

*	SVTs: 
	*	N/A


*	Controls:
	*	The behavior for Azure Security Center (ASC) setup control has been enhanced to evaluate ASC policy state (enabled/disabled) across multiple initiatives.
	*	VM controls scan performance has been improved to fetch resource-specific ASC recommendations only.
	*	Added new control ‘Azure_Subscription_AuthZ_Dont_Grant_Persistent_Access_RG’ to check persistent access at resource group level. This control will get evaluated only during CA scan.
	*	Added the following new controls for app service:
		*	Azure_AppService_DP_Use_Approved_TLS_Version
		*	Azure_AppService_DP_Verify_Installed_Extensions
		*	Azure_AppService_AuthZ_Configure_IP_Restrictions
		*	Azure_AppService_DP_Review_CORS_Request_Credential


*	ARM Template Checker:
	*	Following new controls have been added to ARM Checker:
		*	Azure_APIManagement_NetSec_Configure_Virtual_Network_For_APIM
		*	Azure_APIManagement_AuthN_Use_Managed_Service_Identity
		*	Azure_APIManagement_DP_Use_HTTPS_URL_Scheme
		*	Azure_HDInsight_Deploy_Supported_Cluster_Version

*	CA:
	*	Install-AzSKContinuousAssurance (ICA) can now be run even without owner permissions at subscription scope. The user who ran ICA must get the actual owners to configure RBAC for the AzSK_SPN on the subscription. 
	*	Reduced size of metadata downloads for some VM controls should lead to lower incidence of CA runbook suspension in large subscriptions.
	*	Fixed a bug in CA whereby for external users, CA scans were ignoring resource groups (as specified in the resource groups parameter of ICA) and scanning everything in the subscription.


*	Log Analytics (OMS)
