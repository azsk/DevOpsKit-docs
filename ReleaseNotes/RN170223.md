### Feature updates  
* New version of VSTS task to support multiple resource groups for application scans. 
* New SVTs for Azure Analysis Service, Azure Batch. 
* New PowerBI dashboard in preparation for per-BU telemetry views. 
* Continuous Compliance runbooks are now supported via the Scheduler Service. 
* Preview of 'Recommendation' feature in DevOps Kit OMS events for subscription security checks 
* Preview of a 'single command' installation experience for the DevOps Kit. 
 
 
### Other improvements/bug fixes 
* Mitigated issue from direct dependency on Graph API access for SVTs in CICD and runbooks. Basically the Azure PS module for Graph API has a bug where it does not work correctly while running as an SPN even if correct permissions are granted.  
* Fixed a bug where we were scanning all databases within a SQL server but showing output for only the last one. 
* Updated AppService backup feature control to align with a PG change to the backup API signature. 
* Corrected implementation for firewall IP ranges to address 'any to any' use case for ADLS and Vnets as well. 
* Added exceptions for presence of a couple of management certificates that are required for central services such as ARM-ER deployment.
