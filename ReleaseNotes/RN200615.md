## 200615 (AzSK v.4.10.0)

### Feature updates

* Privileged Identity Management (PIM):
    *	Earlier, role settings could be listed only for eligible assignments via the getpim cmdlet. We have now expanded support to list role settings for active assignments as well at subscription and management group scope.
        ```Powershell
            getpim –ListRoleSettings -SubscriptionId $sub -RoleName Owner

            getpim –ListRoleSettings -ManagementGroupId $MGID -RoleName Owner
        ```
   
*	Security scanner for Azure DevOps (ADO)/ADO Security Scanner extension:
    
    * Introduced alerting and monitoring solution to empower individual teams to view control status of their project components.
    
    * Scanner now supports checkpointing for large scans via a -UsePartialCommits switch. 
    * Added support for bulk attestation feature which empowers teams to provide a common justification for a set of resources all of which have a specific (single) control id that requires attestation.
    * ADO security scanner extension can now be used in release pipelines as well.

* Security Verification Tests (SVTs):
    *	N/A.

* In-cluster security scans for ADB, AKS, HDI Spark:
    * N/A.

* Log Analytics:
    * N/A.

* ARM Template Checker:
    * N/A.

* Org policy/external user updates (for non-CSEO users):
    * Added support for configuring non-AAD identity providers for app service. Refer [here](https://github.com/azsk/DevOpsKit-docs/blob/master/07-Customizing-AzSK-for-your-Org/OrgPolicyUpdate.md) for more information.
    * Fixed an issue in SVT extension framework wherein extended class were not being correctly applied across resources of the same type.

Note: The next few items mention features from recent releases retained for visibility in case you missed those release announcements:

*	Security Scanner for Azure DevOps (ADO) 
    *	You can try the scan cmdlet using:
    ```Powershell
    #ADO scan cmdlet is in a separate module called AzSK.AzureDevOps!
    Install-Module AzSK.AzureDevOps -Scope CurrentUser -AllowClobber    
    Get-AzSKAzureDevOpsSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "MicrosoftIT"`
                                        -ProjectNames "OneITVSO"`
                                        -BuildNames "build_name_here"`
                                        -ReleaseNames "release_name_here"  
    ```

*	Credential Hygiene helper cmdlets  
    * ```New-AzSKTrackedCredential``` to onboard a credential for tracking via DevOps Kit. You can set the reminder period (in days) for the credential.
    * ```Get-AzSKTrackedCredential``` to list the onboarded credential(s).
    * ```Update-AzSKTrackedCredential``` to update the credential settings and reset the last updated timestamp.
    * ```Remove-AzSKTrackedCredential``` to deboard a credential from AzSK tracking.

*	Privileged Identity Management (PIM) helper cmdlets (from last sprint)  
    * ```Set-AzSKPIMConfiguration``` (alias ```setpim```) for configuring/changing PIM settings
    * ```Get-AzSKPIMConfiguration``` (alias ```getpim```) for querying various PIM settings/status
    * Activating your PIM role is now as simple as this:
    
      ``` setpim -ActivateMyRole -SubscriptionId $sub -RoleName Owner -DurationInHours 8 -Justification 'ad hoc test'  ```
    * See docs [here](https://github.com/azsk/DevOpsKit-docs/blob/master/01-Subscription-Security/Readme.md#azsk-privileged-identity-management-pim-helper-cmdlets-1) for more.

*	(Preview) Security Scan for Azure Active Directory (AAD)
    *	You can scan security controls for your AAD tenant (as either an admin or even as a regular user) using the DevOps Kit AAD Security Scan module.
    *	Use following steps:
        ```Powershell
        # AAD scan cmdlets are packaged as a separate module (AzSK.AAD)
        Install-Module AzSK.AAD -Scope CurrentUser -AllowClobber
        Import-Module AzSK.AAD
        Get-AzSKAADSecurityStatusTenant    # check the tenant (admin)
        Get-AzSKAADSecurityStatusUser      # check objects you own (user)
        ``` 
    *	Caveats: 
        * Do not run these in the same PS session as AzSK. Start a new PS console.
        * Az- modules require .Net Framework v4.7.2.
        * By default, the current cmdlets will scan just 3 objects of each type (Apps/SPNs/Groups, etc.). This is until we work out how best to group/batch scans when scanning the entire tenant. If you want to scan more objects you can use the '-MaxObj' switch in the cmdlets.



### Other improvements/bug fixes
* Subscription Security:
    * Added Azure_Subscription_Configure_Conditional_Access_for_PIM_RG control to check whether conditional access policy for critical roles (User Access Administrator/Owner) is configured at resource group scope.

* Privileged Identity Management (PIM):
   * N/A.

* SVTs: 
   * Fixed a bug in attestation workflow where previously if there was no previous attestation history in the subscription and multiple controls were being targeted for attestation, then only the first control in the list was being attested.
    
* Controls:
    * Anonymous blob access control is now enabled for Data Lake Storage Gen2 resources.
    * Multiple controls have been enabled for APIM resources configured in consumption tier. These controls check for least access privileges, HTTPS enablement, CORS access, MSI, etc. on consumption tier APIM resources.
    * Controls Azure_APIManagement_AuthN_Use_AAD_for_Client_AuthN and Azure_APIManagement_DP_Dont_Checkin_Secrets_In_Source will now emit manual status for APIM resources where port 3443 is restricted.
    * Azure_KeyVault_AuthN_Dont_Share_KeyVault_Unless_Trust will now check for shared access on key vaults for enterprise applications apart from AAD applications.
    * Resolved issues in firewall and IP controls for CosmosDB which were earlier resulting into error state due to recent API changes.
    * Trimmed state data of virtual network peering control for ExpressRoute-connected VMs which was previously causing unwanted state drift due to changes unrelated to peering.

* ARM Template Checker:
    * N/A.

* CA:
    * N/A.

* In-cluster CA:
    * N/A. 

* Log Analytics:
    * N/A.

* Known issues:
    * N/A.
