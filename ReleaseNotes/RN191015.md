## 191015 (AzSK v.4.2.0)

### Feature updates

* DevOps Kit controls expressed as Azure Policy (in progress):
	* Authored Azure Policy for 30 more DevOps Kit controls. These will be submitted to the Azure Security Center (ASC) team for inclusion in the ASC initiative.
    
* CICD:
    * DevOps Kit CICD SVT task can now optionally also cover subscription security controls.

*	In-cluster security scans for ADB, AKS, HDI Spark: 
    * In-cluster CA cmdlets (Install, Get, Update & Remove-CA) for AKS are now available in the main AzSK module.
    * In-cluster CA now supports sending scan telemetry to log analytics (LA) workspace for AKS. This can be configured by using the ``` Install-AzSKContinuousAssuranceForCluster ``` cmdlet.
    * Added 2 new in-cluster security controls for AKS.


*	Log Analytics:
    * N/A.

*	ARM Template Checker:
    * N/A.

*	Org policy/external user updates (for non-CSEO users):
    * Removed a check that was prohibiting use of custom-generated SPNs in central-mode CA.

Note: The next few items mention features from recent releases retained for visibility in case you missed those release announcements:

*	Credential Hygiene helper cmdlets (from last sprint)  
    * ```New-AzSKTrackedCredential``` to onboard a credential for tracking via DevOps Kit. You can set the reminder period (in days) for the credential.
    * ```Get-AzSKTrackedCredential``` to list the onboarded credential(s).
    * ```Update-AzSKTrackedCredential``` to update the credential settings and reset the last updated timestamp.
    * ```Remove-AzSKTrackedCredential``` to deboard a credential from AzSK tracking.

*	Privileged Identity Management (PIM) helper cmdlets (from last sprint)  
    * ```Set-AzSKPIMConfiguration``` for configuring/changing PIM settings
    * ```Get-AzSKPIMConfiguration``` for querying various PIM settings/status
    * Activating your PIM role is now as simple as this:
    
    ``` setpim -ActivateMyRole -SubscriptionId $s5 -DurationInHours 8 -Justification 'ad hoc test' -RoleName Owner ```
    * See docs [here](https://github.com/azsk/DevOpsKit-docs/blob/master/01-Subscription-Security/Readme.md#azsk-privileged-identity-management-pim-helper-cmdlets-1) for more.

*	(Preview) Security Scan for Azure Active Directory (AAD)
    *	You can scan security controls for your AAD tenant (as either an admin or even as a regular user) using the DevOps Kit AAD Security Scan module.
    *	Use following steps:
    ```Powershell
    # AAD scan cmdlets are packaged as a separate module (AzSK.AAD)
    Install-Module AzSK.AAD -Scope CurrentUser -AllowClobber
    Import-Module AzSK.AAD
    Get-AzSKAADSecurityStatusTenant    # check the tenant (admin)
    Get-AzSKAADSecurityStatusUser      # check objects you own (user)
    ``` 
    *	Caveats: 
        * Do not run these in the same PS session as AzSK. Start a new PS console.
        * Az- modules require .Net Framework v4.7.2.
        * By default, the current cmdlets will scan just 3 objects of each type (Apps/SPNs/Groups, etc.). This is until we work out how best to group/batch scans when scanning the entire tenant. If you want to scan more objects you can use the '-MaxObj' switch in the cmdlets.

*	(Preview) AzSK module for Azure DevOps (ADO/VSTS) 
    *	You can try the scan cmdlet using:
  ```Powershell
  #VSTS scan cmdlet is in a separate module called AzSK.AzureDevOps!
  Install-Module AzSK.AzureDevOps -Scope CurrentUser -AllowClobber    
  Get-AzSKAzureDevOpsSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "MicrosoftIT"`
                                    -ProjectNames "OneITVSO"`
                                    -BuildNames "build_name_here"`
                                    -ReleaseNames "release_name_here"  
  ```

### Other improvements/bug fixes
*	Subscription Security:
    * N/A.

*	SVTs: 
    * Fixed an issue wherein fetching role assignments for Cloud Service Provider (CSP) subscriptions was resulting in an error (addresses the fact that CSP subscriptions do not have classic admins).
    * Fixed a regression regarding telemetry for Env & ComponentId tags from security scans. 

*	Controls:
     * Azure Security Center (ASC) std-tier requirement control has been augmented to check pricing tier for individual resource types (Virtual Machines, App Services, SQL Servers & Storage accounts).
     * The app service Managed Service Identity (MSI) control will now emit a ‘passed’ status (instead of ‘verify’) if MSI is enabled.
     * The following new controls have been added to various SVTs:
        * Azure_Storage_AuthN_Use_AAD_Based_Access
        * Azure_Storage_AuthZ_Grant_Min_RBAC_Access
        * Azure_Storage_AuthZ_Restrict_Network_Access
        * Azure_Storage_BCDR_Enable_Soft_Delete
        * Azure_KubernetesService_DP_Disable_HTTP_Application_Routing

    * Following new controls have been added to ARM Checker:
      *	Azure_AnalysisServices_AuthZ_Min_Admin

*	CA:
    *	N/A. 

*	Privileged Identity Management (PIM):
    * Added support for assigning roles to multiple users when using the -AssignRole flag.
    ```
    setpim -AssignRole -SubscriptionId $subid -RoleName $roleName -PrincipalName 'x@microsoft.com, y@microsoft.com, z@microsoft.com' -DurationInDays $days
    ```

    * Documentation representing an end-to-end workflow for AzSK PIM cmdlets will be published [here](https://github.com/azsk/DevOpsKit-docs/tree/master/01-Subscription-Security) this week.
