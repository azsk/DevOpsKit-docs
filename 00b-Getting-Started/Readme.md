# Getting started with the Secure DevOps Kit for Azure!

If you have just installed the Secure DevOps Kit for Azure (a.k.a. AzSK) and are not familiar with 
its functionality, then you can get started with the 2 most basic use cases of AzSK by going through 
the following getting started guides:
- [Scan the security of your subscription](GettingStarted_SubscriptionSecurity.md)
- [Scan the security of your cloud application](GettingStarted_AzureServiceSecurity.md)  

Thereafter, you can explore individual features further using the table of contents below which has 
pointers to full help on individual features by feature area.

> **Note:** If you have not installed the DevOps Kit yet, follow the instructions in the [installation guide](../00a-Setup/Readme.md) and then come back here.

> **PowerShell Tips for AzSK:** 
> If you are new to PowerShell, then you will find several useful tips in our [PowerShell tips for new AzSK Users](GettingStarted_PowerShellTipsAzSK.md) guide 
> handy to accelerate your initial learning curve for PowerShell competencies needed to use AzSK effectively.
