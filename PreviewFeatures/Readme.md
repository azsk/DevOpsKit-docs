# Preview Features

### Configure new runtime account in CA
Now you can configure new runtime account by running UCA (Update-AzSKContinuousAssurance) command with switch "-NewRuntimeAccount". 
This feature is helpful in case when CA certificate is expired but the SPN owner who had setup CA is not available, due to that certificate can't be renewed. This command will setup new runtime account and the person running the command will become new SPN owner.

### User Comments/Custom Tags

To track compliance progress on your subscription you can place 'custom tags/comments' on controls, these comments will be persisted inside your subscription's AzSK storage account. Anyone across your subscription can read the comments later by running GSS/GRS/GCS command with switch "-IncludeUserComments". 

> **Note:** You need to explicitly enable this feature for your subscription. To do so, Please run following command:
>```PowerShell
>    Set-AzSKUserPreference -PersistScanReportInSubscription
>```
	
#### How to add/update user comments?

Please follow the following steps to update user comments:

Step 1: Run GRS/GSS/GCS cmd with “-IncludeUserComments” switch. For e.g.

Step 2: Edit/Update “UserComments” column and save file.	

Step 3: Upload edited .CSV file using below cmdlt,
```PowerShell
      Update-AzSKPersistedState -SubscriptionId  <Your SubscriptionId> -FilePath <Path for updated CSV file> -StateType "UserComments"
```    
#### How to read user comments?
