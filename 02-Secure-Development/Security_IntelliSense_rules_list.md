### **Rule - authn_web_cookie_expiry**

**Message**
<br/>
Set cookie expiry to be as short as possible...especially if the cookie is being used for authenticated sessions.
<br/>
<br/>
**Description**
<br/>
Long cookie expiry periods increase the exposure and exploitability of a cookie in the event that it gets stolen.
<br/>
<br/>
***
### **Rule - authn_web_cookie_httponly**

**Message**
<br/>
Set httponly to true to reduce risk of JavaScript accessing the cookies
<br/>
<br/>
**Description**
<br/>
Set httponly to true to reduce risk of JavaScript accessing the cookies
<br/>
<br/>
***
### **Rule - authn_web_cookie_secure_flag**

**Message**
<br/>
Set secure to true to reduce risk of sending cookie over plain HTTP.
<br/>
<br/>
**Description**
<br/>
Setting secure flag to true for a cookie ensures that the browser will never send it over a non-HTTPS connection. This protects the cookie from network layer disclosure.
<br/>
<br/>
***
### **Rule - authn_web_formsauthticket_timeout**

**Message**
<br/>

***
### **Rule - azure_aad_authority_validation_turned_off**

**Message**
<br/>
Authority validation should not be disabled for AAD security tokens.
<br/>
<br/>
**Description**
<br/>
Disabling authority validation implies that any well-formed token will get accepted regardless of which authority signed the token. This is rarely desirable. Do not explicitly set the validation to 'false' in the AuthenticationContext. The default value is 'true'.
<br/>
<br/>
***
### **Rule - azure_aad_avoid_custom_token_caching**

**Message**
<br/>
Custom token cache identified. Allow ADAL to transparently handle any caching needs for tokens.
<br/>
<br/>
**Description**
<br/>
Do not use custom caches for ADAL tokens. The ADAL library uses a in-memory cache for the storage of tokens when no custom tokencache is provided explicitly to its AuthenticationContext constructor.
<br/>
<br/>
***
### **Rule - azure_aad_avoid_memberof**

**Message**
<br/>
The 'memberOf' method is not transitive, i.e. it doesn't return nested groups. As a result, it might lead to security bypass in certain cases.
<br/>
<br/>
**Description**
<br/>
The 'memberOf' method is used for checking the group membership of a user. This method is not transitive, i.e. it doesn't return nested groups. As a result, it might lead to security bypass in certain cases. Review if the group membership verification logic in the code would work as intended even when the memberOf method is used. However, it is always recommended to use other API methods listed here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/ad/graph/api/users-operations for checking the group membership.
<br/>
<br/>
***
### **Rule - azure_adal_avoid_accesstoken_in_code**

**Message**
<br/>
Explicit usage of accesstoken found in the code: access tokens should be handled securely. It is recommended not to store it separately in a persistent storage like databases or files, unless there is a compelling requirement.
<br/>
<br/>
**Description**
<br/>
It is recommended to use ADAL library for acquiring the tokens as it saves them securely in an internal in-memory cache in its default configuration.
<br/>
<br/>
***
### **Rule - azure_adal_avoid_refreshtoken_in_code**

**Message**
<br/>
Explicit usage of refreshtoken found in the code: refresh tokens should be handled securely. It is recommended not to store it separately in a persistent storage like database and files, unless there is a compelling requirement.
<br/>
<br/>
**Description**
<br/>
It is recommended to use ADAL library for acquiring the tokens as it saves them securely in a internal in-memory cache in its default configuration
<br/>
<br/>
***
### **Rule - azure_sbr_no_client_authentication**

**Message**
<br/>
It is unsafe to use 'RelayClientAuthenticationType.None' as it allows clients to connect to the relay without authentication. Use RelayClientAuthenticationType.RelayAccessToken.
<br/>
<br/>
**Description**
<br/>
When using a service bus relays, clients have to authenticate to the relay in order to use it to connect to the on-premise endpoint. If 'None' is used for RelayClientAuthenticationType, it means any client (without credentials) can connect to the relay and attempt to reach the on-premise service.
<br/>
<br/>
***
### **Rule - azure_storage_blob_public_access**

**Message**
<br/>
The chosen setting for BlobContainerPublicAccessType  will allow 'public' access of blobs within this container (without requiring an access token). This should be carefully evaluated in the context of the scenario.
<br/>
<br/>
**Description**
<br/>
The chosen setting for BlobContainerPublicAccessType  will allow 'public' access of blobs within this container (without requiring an access token). It is recommended to use BlobContainerPublicAccessType.Off unless it absolutely required. Creation of containers with unrestricted access should be carefully evaluated in the context of the scenario.
<br/>
<br/>
***
### **Rule - azure_storage_container_public_access**

**Message**
<br/>
The chosen setting for BlobContainerPublicAccessType  will allow 'public' access of blobs within this container (without requiring an access token). This should be carefully evaluated in the context of the scenario.
<br/>
<br/>
**Description**
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
***
### **Rule - azure_storage_sas_use_https**

**Message**
<br/>
The 'HttpsOrHttp' option is insecure as it allows use of Http (plaintext) for content request and transfer. Use SharedAccessProtocol.HttpsOnly.
<br/>
<br/>
**Description**
<br/>
Use of 'HttpsOrHttp' implies that both the request content and any headers (including SAS tokens) will get transferred over plaintext. Instead use SharedAccessProtocol.HttpsOnly to ensure the transfer is encrypted.
<br/>
<br/>
***
### **Rule - azure_storage_sastoken_validity_too_long**

**Message**
<br/>
Use shortest possible token lifetime appropriate for the scenario. See AAD default token expiration times here.
<br/>
<br/>
**Description**
<br/>
It is recommended to set appropriate and short lifetime for tokens. Typically access tokens should have a validity period of a few hours (ideally kept as small as practical).
<br/>
<br/>
***
### **Rule - crypto_certs_weak_hmac**

**Message**
<br/>
The X509Certificate2 class does not support SHA256-based signatures.
<br/>

**Message**
<br/>
The Random class is a cryptographically weak random number generator.
<br/>
<br/>
**Description**
<br/>
When used in the context of crypto, random number generators should be cryptographically secure. The class Random does not meet the requirements and should not be used. Consider using RNGCryptoServiceProvider instead.
